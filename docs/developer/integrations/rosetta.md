# IoTeX Rosetta Gateway

IoTeX provides an implementation of the [Rosetta API](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go) Gateway from [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com).
Rosetta is an open standard and a set of tools designed to simplify blockchain deployment and interaction. For more informations about Rosetta see the [project website](https://www.rosetta-api.org/).

## Deploy Rosetta Gateway

You can deploy the IoTeX Rosetta gateway along with the IoTeX Mainnet node by following the current Build&Run documentation for the **IoTeX Rosetta Gateway** on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core-rosetta-gateway#iotex-gateway-for-rosetta)

## Your Exchange doesn't implement Rosetta?

Go ahead, and check out the [general integration guide](guide)!

## Testing

Once you've fully integrated with the IoTeX blockchain, please make accurate tests on both testnet and mainnet. All states of the IoTeX blockchain can be queried through either the command line tool [ioctl](/developer/get-started/ioctl-install) or the official IoTeX explorers for ([Mainnet](https://iotexscan.io)Ã¬ and [Testnet](https://testnet.iotexscan.io)).

Please reach to IoTeX Team if you have any question.
