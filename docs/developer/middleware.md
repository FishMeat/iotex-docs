### The IoT Middleware Layer

IoTeX not only excels in blockchain, but also in core middleware components that we have fine-tuned for IoT. What truly differentiates IoTeX from other platforms is our focus on middleware that enables trusted devices and user-owned data:

- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: IoTeX’s decentralized identity framework enables devices to register an identity to the blockchain — to discover and be discovered — and also own its own data. “Self-sovereignty” for people (e.g., Sovrin, uPort) is common, but extending this concept and granting identities to devices opens the door to new human-machine and machine-machine use cases. Not all DIDs are created equal — IoTeX’s DID spec is advanced for both people and devices and is evolving at an exciting pace.

- **Decentralized Storage**: All of that IoT data … where does it all go? IoTeX offers flexible storage options via Cloud or decentralized storage, where data is “hashed” to the blockchain for verifiability and data provenance. IoTeX enforces protections for data at-rest and in-transit, and we are working closely with the IPFS team on decentralized encrypted storage for Ucam, which can be extended to other “Powered by IoTeX” devices in the future. See IoTeX’s Keynote at the IPFS Summit for more details.

- **Confidential Computing**: Once we own our data, the final step is to build applications where we can utilize our data while maintaining full privacy. By leveraging secure hardware, IoTeX enables privacy-preserving computations over encrypted data to unlock the future of user-centric applications. “Don’t bring the data to the code, bring the code to the data”.
