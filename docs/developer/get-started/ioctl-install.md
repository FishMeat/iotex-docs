title: Install ioctl client
---

# Command line client

The most basic tool for a IoTeX developer to get started is **ioctl**: a command-line interface that can communicate with a IoTeX [gateway](/introduction/node-concept) node, allowing you to query and send [actions](/introduction/action-concept) to the blockchain. You can quickly download and install the latest release of ioctl typing the following command in a terminal window:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/master/install-cli.sh | sh
```

::: tip
ioctl is a powerful tool to interact with the IoTeX blockchain, and it also provides additional utility commands to be used locally: we will see some of the basic commands that you need to get started but you can also [check out the full reference documentation](ioctl-reference).
