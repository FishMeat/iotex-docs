## IoTeX Decentralized Identity Overview

Self-sovereign identity is user- and device-centric where an individual or organization or device is able to own its own identity attributes without relying on third-party service providers. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable 'self-sovereign' digital identity for individuals, organizations and things. DIDs have the following important properties:

- **Decentralized**: DIDs are designed to function without a central registration authority. DIDs are registered in blockchain or other decentralized network.
- **Cryptographically Verifiable**: DIDs are designed to be associated with cryptographic keys and the entities controlling the DID can use those keys to prove ownership.
- **Non-Reassignable**: DIDs should be permanent, persistent, and non-reassignable.
- **Resolvable**: DIDs are made useful through resolution.

IoTeX DID has been integrated by [uniresolver.io](http://uniresolver.io) which is the industrial de facto that resolves DID to the corresponding document

This section provides specification of how DID works within IoTeX Network.
