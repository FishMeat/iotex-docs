# How to get involved

Anyone can be a contributor to the IoTeX project, provided they have signed relevant Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) and follow the project’s [https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/wiki/Contributor-Guide](contribution guidelines). Contributions will be reviewed by a maintainer, and must pass all applicable tests.

Reviews check for code quality and style, including documentation, and enforce other policies. Contributions may be rejected for reasons unrelated to the code in question. For example, a change may be too complex to maintain or duplicate existing functionality.

Note that contributions are not limited to code alone. Bugs, documentation, experience reports or public advocacy are all valuable ways to contribute to a project and build trust in the community.
