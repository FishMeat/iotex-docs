### IoTeX Accounts

An Account represents any entity participanting in the IoTeX network, that can be a user, a device, an enterprise, or even a piece of software that lives on the blockchain itself (a so called _smart contract_). Each IoTeX account always has a "public key" associated to it, that is represented by a 41 characters string starting by `io1...`, and is referred to as the **Address** of the account.

A typical address in the IoTeX blockchain looks like this:

`io1juvx5g063eu4ts832nukp4vgcwk2gnc5cu9ayd`

Similarly to other blockchain platform, in IoTeX we have two type of accounts: **owned** accounts that have a known **private key** associated to them, and **smart contract accounts** that do not have a known private key associated with them.

### Owned Accounts

For owned accounts, the private key is used to _sign_ transactions on the behalf of the account itself: because each and every account address has one and only one associated private key, we can say that any blockchain transaction that is signed with a certain private key _is owned_ by the account whose address is the one generated by that private key.

While the address of an account can be generated from the private key, it's not possible to trace the private key that generated a certain address from the knowledge of the address alone.

### Smart contract Accounts

As anticipated, smart contract accounts do not have a private key associated to it, therefore they cannot initiate transactions: a contract address can only be the destination of transactions. On the other side, a smart contract address has some **executable code** associated to it, that gets executed each time a transaction is sent to its account address.
