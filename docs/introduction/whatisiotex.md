title: What is IoTeX

# What is IoTeX?

IoTeX was founded in 2017 as an open source project, with the vision of bringing together **people**, **processes**, **data** and **things** with trust and free will, to create new capabilities, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunities.

IoTeX is an open platform aiming to be the **global trust backbone** for connecting distinct parties, intelligently and efficiently, where the blockchain is just one component of this platform: the one that **orchestrates** and provides **trust** among all network participants.

The Internet of Things is changing the way we live and work. Today, IoT lets us gather data **from any connected device**, and use it to enhance our business processes and daily lives.

But we’re only at the start of our journey to realize the full potential of IoT: What if we **didn’t have to rely on centralized parties** to store and transfer our private data? What if we could **make IoT affordable, scalable and widely adoptable**? What if all IoT networks could **interoperate and share data autonomously**, seamlessly and securely? What if we told you - **blockchain is the answer**?

## The infrastructure for the Internet of Things

IoTeX is not just an enhancement to existing IoT technology - it’s a completely new vision for the future of IoT, to make autonomous device coordination a reality: We built IoTeX from scratch, and made **upfront design decisions** to tailor fit blockchain technology for IoT, using advanced lightweight cryptography to ensure privacy of all data in the IoTeX network.

Our **Roll-DPoS consensus mechanism** provides instant finality and the throughput needed to support **billions** of IoT devices. Our scalable **blockchains-in-blockchain** architecture enables anyone to create their own IoT ecosystems, orchestrate devices via **smart contracts**, and share their data across the IoTeX network.

IoTeX will allow us to dream bigger, and create revolutionary IoT applications and services: the possibilities are endless.

Join us on our journey to create the foundation for tomorrow’s Internet of Things, by “connecting the physical world - block by block.”
