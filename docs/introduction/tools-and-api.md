### Developer Tools & APIs Layer

Another major focus for IoTeX in the past months and surely in the future is to make developing on IoTeX intuitive, efficient, and fun for both developers and companies. We have been fortunate to collaborate with IoT standards organizations (e.g., IIC, IEEE), enterprises (e.g., Nordic Semiconductor, Tenvis), and open source technologies (e.g., IPFS, ThingsBoard) to make all of the blockchain infrastructure and middleware accessible and usable by developers of all skill levels. We canâ€™t wait to see what you will build!

- IoT Edge Oracle: in-house data oracle to port real world data from registered devices to the blockchain for use in smart contracts with end-to-end trust (whitepaper coming soon).

- IoT Data Dashboards: integration with ThingsBoard, a powerful open source data visualization tool to create your own IoT dashboards. Expect to see beautiful dashboards for IoTeX devices like Pebble Tracker very soon!

- Smart Contract Tools: new and improved IoTeX command-line tool (ioctl) with smart contract deployment capabilities, and planned integrations with smart contract tools like Truffle.
