# Blockchain Wallet

A blokchain wallet is a tool to safely encrypt and store private keys, sign actions and broadcast them to the blockchain.

[IoPay](https://iopay.iotex.io/) is the wallet built by the IoTeX team for everyone to manage their digital assets on the IoTeX blockchain. Additionally, it supports Staking & Voting for Delegates, Fungible Tokens (XRC20), Non-Fungible Tokens, and much more!

Many other existing software and wallet apps have integrated support for the IoTeX Blockchain, check them all on the IoTeX [Ecosystem Page - Coming soon!](#)
