## Staking & Voting in IoTeX

IoTeX is a digital democracy where token holders **vote** for Delegates to **maintain and grow the network**. The top 36 voted Delegates are **Consensus Delegates** that manage consensus on behalf of the entire IoTeX network.

By becoming a Voter in the IoTeX ecosystem, you will actively contribute to the security of the entire network, and doing so you will get staking rewards from the delegates you voted for.

Any IOTX Token Holder can be a Voter in the IoTeX Network. To become a voter you need to:

- Hold your tokens in a IoTeX Wallet that **you own**
- Stake your tokens to generate **buckets of votes**
- Assign your buckets of votes to your favourite delegate
